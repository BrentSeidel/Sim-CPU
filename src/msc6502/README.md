# MOS Technologies 6502
This is an instruction set simulator.  No effort has been made for timing or
cycle accuracy.  Software that does not depend on instruction timing will
probably work.

All the 6502 instructions and addressing modes have been implemented and
tested.  Interrupts and memory mapped I/O have been implemented and tested.
