*  There is a fairly comprehensive test program at https://github.com/MicroCoreLabs/Projects/tree/master/MCL68/MC68000_Test_Code
*  But the simulator doesn't yet have enough implemented to have a hope
*  of running that.  Eventually, it should be run.
*
*  Test program for CHK instruction
*
*  Vector for CHK instruction
*
    ORG 6*4
    DC.L CHK6
*
    ORG $1000

START:  ; First instruction of program
    ADD.W #100,D0
    ADD.W #2000,D1
    ADD.W #$FFFF,D2
*
    CHK #1000,D0
    CHK #1000,D1
    CHK #1000,D2

*
*  Handler for CHK exception.  Does nothing and actaully won't be used
*  until the simulator actually implements exceptions.

CHK6: RTE
